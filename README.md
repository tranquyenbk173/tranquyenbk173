### Hi there 👋

- My name is Quyen Tran, 
- 🔭 I’m currently working at VinAI Research as a Research Resident. My research primarily centers on *Continual Learning, Transfer Learning, and Robust Machine Learning*, with the goal of developing ***truly intelligent and reliable systems***. These systems are expected to actively <u>accumulate and consolidate knowledge</u> over time while also being <u>safe, private, and trustworthy</u>.
